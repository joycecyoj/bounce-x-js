# Overlay Sample

This is a JavaScript snippet that can be run in the console of the browser and triggers an overlay on top of the site (Marmot.com) when the user scrolls into the bottom 10% of the page. The overlay displays the number of items in the cart, the cart total, and the item images from the page. It also has two buttons which allows the user to close the overlay or navigates to the cart page.
